# ITU labs

This is a repository with my own solutions to ITU laboratories.
**Please, don't copy anything from this repository unless you understand the topic or the code, you would like to copy.**
Understanding the logic of the code is the fundamental step to understanding topics covered in lectures.
This repository is made for people who sometimes tend to get stuck and don't want to be completely lost and lose points.
